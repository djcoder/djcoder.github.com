Hi, my name is Cameron Bentley.
=======
I'm an aspiring programmer and web developer. I learnt most of my stuff from books, the internet, and boredom. 
I have achieved a number of really cool things with computers, and I will only now be entering the open source playground. In the past, I've made:
 - A video game in CryEngine 3
 - Android and WP7 app (restaurant saver - saves memorable restaurants into a favorite list and suggets them in the future)
 - XDA handset development - I have done quite some work debugging Android bugs on XDA ported roms
 - Made an app for a school project
 - Many more things that were probably only cool as I had achieved them!

Hopefully I can make some meaningful contributions to the open source community.
Have a good day,
 -Cameron
