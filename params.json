{"body":"### Hi, I'm Cameron Bentley, aka. DJCoder.\r\nI'm an aspiring programmer and web developer. I learnt most of my stuff from books, the internet, and boredom. \r\nI have achieved a number of really cool things with computers, and I will only now be entering the open source playground. \r\n\r\n### Cool stuff I've made\r\nIn the past, I've made:\r\n - A video game in CryEngine 3 (although rather small at 2 levels :D)\r\n - Android and WP7 app (restaurant saver - saves memorable restaurants into a favorite list and suggets them in the future)\r\n - XDA handset development - I have done quite some work debugging Android bugs on XDA ported roms\r\n - Made an app for a school project\r\n - Many more things that were probably only cool as I had achieved them!\r\n\r\n### About Me\r\nI'm a 14-year old. I live in Canada, but have traveled around most of the world - I was born in Hong Kong to my British parents, and we lived there for a few years before moving to the UK, and not long ago out to Canada.\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\nThanks to:\r\n - My parents for their immense support when I was tearing my face off at CryEngine's AI system!\r\n - My friends for helping with projects\r\n - XDA-Developers.com\r\n - And more people who I've forgotten and/or not appreciated :) (sorry)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nEmail: me@djcoder.com\r\n\r\n### Thanks for stopping by!\r\nI hope I've left a good impression! Have a great day,\r\n -Cameron","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","tagline":"Aspiring Programmer and Web Developer","name":"DJCoder"}
