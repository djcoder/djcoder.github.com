        <h3>Hi, I'm Cameron Bentley, aka. DJCoder.</h3>

<p>I'm an aspiring programmer and web developer. I learnt most of my stuff from books, the internet, and boredom. 
I have achieved a number of really cool things with computers, and I will only now be entering the open source playground. </p>

<h3>Cool stuff I've made</h3>

<p>In the past, I've made:</p>

<ul>
<li>A video game in CryEngine 3 (although rather small at 2 levels :D)</li>
<li>Android and WP7 app (restaurant saver - saves memorable restaurants into a favorite list and suggets them in the future)</li>
<li>XDA handset development - I have done quite some work debugging Android bugs on XDA ported roms</li>
<li>Made an app for a school project</li>
<li>Many more things that were probably only cool as I had achieved them!</li>
</ul><h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I'm a 14-year old. I live in Canada, but have traveled around most of the world - I was born in Hong Kong to my British parents, and we lived there for a few years before moving to the UK, and not long ago out to Canada.</p>

<h3>Thanks</h3>

<p>Thanks to:</p>

<ul>
<li>My parents for their immense support when I was tearing my face off at CryEngine's AI system!</li>
<li>My friends for helping with projects</li>
<li>XDA-Developers.com</li>
<li>And more people who I've forgotten and/or not appreciated :) (sorry)</li>
</ul><h3>Contact</h3>

<p>Email: <a href="mailto:me@djcoder.com">me@djcoder.com</a></p>

<h3>Thanks for stopping by!</h3>

<p>I hope I've left a good impression! Have a great day,
 -Cameron</p>
